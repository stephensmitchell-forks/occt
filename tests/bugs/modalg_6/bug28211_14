# We create new face, which is not-closed in 2D-space.
# This gap is created between two 2D-representations
# of seam-edges (it is known fact that seam-edge has
# two p-curves on the face) and is covered by the tolerance
# of the vertex, which is shared between two edges.
# After that, point is classified, which is
# out of the face UV-bounds.
