# The main problem is in classifier-algorithm.
# The intersection curve is found but is rejected
# by BOP-operation because some intermediate point
# of this curve is classified as OUT. 
# Good fix must create adecvate polygon for classification,
# which will respect the pcurve of the face with some deflection
# (see method BRepTopAdaptor_FClass2d::Init(...)).
# Currently, this polygon is wrong.
